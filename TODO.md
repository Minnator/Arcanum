# Plugin System Implementation Checklist

1. [DONE] **Plugin Metadata System**  
   Define and expose metadata such as name, version, and author to help identify and manage plugins.

2. **Plugin Contracts**  
   Create specific interfaces for different extension types (e.g., tools, UI elements, map overlays).

3. [DONE] **Event System Enhancements**  
   Support strongly-typed events to improve safety and flexibility when communicating between host and plugins.

4. [DONE] **Versioning & Compatibility**  
   Implement version checks to ensure plugins are compatible with the host application.

5. **Exception Isolation**  
   Ensure that plugin errors are caught and logged without affecting the stability of the host.

6. **Dependency Management**  
   Load plugins from isolated directories with their own dependencies using separate assembly load contexts.

7. [DONE] **Plugin Configuration**  
    Allows plugins to store and retrieve configuration data, possibly in a dedicated section of the host's settings.

8. **Unloading / Reloading**  
   Support unloading and reloading plugins at runtime to free resources or update functionality without restarting the app.

9. **UI Integration Hooks**  
   Provide hook points in the user interface for plugins to add buttons, panels, overlays, or other controls.

10. **Plugin Lifecycle**  
    Support a clean lifecycle including initialization and optional shutdown/cleanup hooks for plugin management.
